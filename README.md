  trigger. The delay time is a random time between the time the task triggers
  and the time that you specify in this setting.

  computer is idle.
* IdleWaitTimeout: Specifies the amount of time that Task Scheduler waits for an
  idle condition to occur. DateTime ;
* NetworkName: Specifies the name of a network profile that Task Scheduler uses
  to determine if the task can run. The Task Scheduler UI uses this setting for
  display purposes. Specify a network name if you specify theRunOnlyIfNetworkAvailable
  parameter.
* DisallowStartOnRemoteAppSession: Indicates that the task does not start if the
  task is triggered to run in a Remote Applications Integrated Locally (RAIL) session.
* StartWhenAvailable: Indicates that Task Scheduler can start the task at any
  time after its scheduled time has passed.
* DontStopIfGoingOnBatteries: Indicates that the task does not stop if the
  computer switches to battery power.
* WakeToRun: Indicates that Task Scheduler wakes the computer before it runs the
  task.
* IdleDuration: Specifies the amount of time that the computer must be in an idle
  state before Task Scheduler runs the task.
* RestartOnIdle: Indicates that Task Scheduler restarts the task when the computer
  cycles into an idle condition more than once.

  and 6 are used for interactive tasks.
* RestartCount: Specifies the number of times that Task Scheduler attempts to
  restart the task.
* RestartInterval: Specifies the amount of time that Task Scheduler attempts to
  restart the task.
* RunOnlyIfNetworkAvailable: Indicates that Task Scheduler runs the task only
  when a network is available. Task Scheduler uses the NetworkID parameter and
  NetworkName parameter that you specify in this cmdlet to determine if the
  network is available.
