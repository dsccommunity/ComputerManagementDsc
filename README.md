# xComputerManagement

The xComputerManagement module is a part of the Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) Resource Kit, which is a collection of DSC Resources produced by the PowerShell Team.
This module contains the xComputer resource.
This DSC Resource allows you to rename a computer and add it to a domain or workgroup.

All of the resources in the DSC Resource Kit are provided AS IS, and are not supported through any Microsoft standard support program or service.
The ""x" in xComputerManagement stands for experimental, which means that these resources will be fix forward and monitored by the module owner(s).

Please leave comments, feature requests, and bug reports in the Issues tab for this module.

## Examples
### Change the Name and the Workgroup Name

This configuration will set a machine name and changes the workgroup it is in.

```powershell
configuration Sample_xComputer_ChangeNameAndWorkGroup
{
    param
    (
        [string[]]$NodeName ='localhost',

        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [string]$MachineName,

        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [string]$WorkGroupName
    )

    #Import the required DSC Resources
    Import-DscResource -Module xComputerManagement

    Node $NodeName
    {
        xComputer NewNameAndWorkgroup
        {
            Name          = $MachineName
            WorkGroupName = $WorkGroupName
        }
    }
}
```

### Switch from a Workgroup to a Domain
This configuration sets the machine name and joins a domain.
Note: this requires a credential.

```powershell
configuration Sample_xComputer_WorkgroupToDomain
{
    param
    (
        [string[]]$NodeName="localhost",

        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [string]$MachineName,

        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [string]$Domain,

        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [pscredential]$Credential
    )

    #Import the required DSC Resources
    Import-DscResource -Module xComputerManagement

    Node $NodeName
    {
        xComputer JoinDomain
        {
            Name          = $MachineName
            DomainName    = $Domain
            Credential    = $Credential  # Credential to join to domain
        }
    }
}


<#****************************
To save the credential in plain-text in the mof file, use the following configuration data

$ConfigData = @{
                 AllNodes = @(
                              @{
                                 NodeName = "localhost"
                                 # Allows credential to be saved in plain-text in the the *.mof instance document.

                                 PSDscAllowPlainTextPassword = $true
                              }
                            )
              }

Sample_xComputer_WorkgroupToDomain -ConfigurationData $ConfigData -MachineName <machineName> -credential (Get-Credential) -Domain <domainName>

                                # Allows credential to be saved in plain-text in the the *.mof instance document.

                                PSDscAllowPlainTextPassword = $true;
                          }
                 )
            }

            WorkGroupName = $WorkGroup
            Credential    = $Credential # Credential to unjoin from domain
        }
    }
}

<#****************************

                                # Allows credential to be saved in plain-text in the the *.mof instance document.

                                PSDscAllowPlainTextPassword = $true;
                              }
                           )
                }

Sample_xComputer_DomainToWorkgroup -ConfigurationData $ConfigData -MachineName <machineName> -credential (Get-Credential) -WorkGroup <workgroupName>

configuration Sample_xOfflineDomainJoin
{
    param
    (
        [string[]]$NodeName = 'localhost'
    )

    Import-DSCResource -ModuleName xComputerManagement

    Node $NodeName
    {
        xOfflineDomainJoin ODJ
        {
          RequestFile = 'C:\ODJ\ODJRequest.txt'
          IsSingleInstance = 'Yes'
        }
    }
}

Sample_xOfflineDomainJoin
Start-DscConfiguration -Path Sample_xOfflineDomainJoin -Wait -Verbose -Force
```

### Run a PowerShell script every 15 minutes on a server
This example will create a scheduled task that will call PowerShell.exe every 15 minutes to run a script saved locally.
The script will be called as the local system account

```powershell
configuration Sample_xScheduledTask
{
    param
    (
        [string[]]$NodeName = 'localhost'
    )

    Import-DSCResource -ModuleName xComputerManagement

    Node $NodeName
    {
        xScheduledTask MaintenanceScriptExample
        {
          TaskName = "Custom maintenance tasks"
          ActionExecutable = "C:\windows\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe"
          ActionArguments = "-File `"C:\scripts\my custom script.ps1`""
          ScheduleType = "Minutes"
          RepeatInterval = 15
        }
    }
}

Sample_xScheduledTask
Start-DscConfiguration -Path Sample_xScheduledTask -Wait -Verbose -Force
