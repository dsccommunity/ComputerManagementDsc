    .EXAMPLE
    This example creates a scheduled task called 'Test task Daily' in the folder
    task folder 'MyTasks' that starts a new powershell process every day at 00:00 repeating
    every 15 minutes for 8 hours. If the task fails it will be restarted after 5 minutes
    and it will be restarted a maximum of two times. It will only run if the network
    is connected and will wake the machine up to execute the task.
